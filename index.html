                    <p>This paper introduces a graph-powered interpretable ML model for abnormality detection, integrating self-awareness (SA) and collective awareness (CA) functionalities in agent networks. Using generative Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) and a Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF), interpretability is achieved via graph matching of semantic vocabulary. This approach enables the model to self-explain its decisions and incrementally update learned representations based on anomalies.</p>

                    <p>This article develops collective awareness (CA) models for networked autonomous vehicles, enabling synchronous abnormality detection across the system. It employs data-driven DBNs inferred by a Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF), utilizing Hellinger distance metrics to quantify anomalies. The significance lies in assessing the model's robustness against realistic communication channel effects, including packet loss and delay via the IEEE 802.11p protocol.</p>

                        A framework to correlate power consumption and resource usage in cloud infrastructures
                    </a>
                    <p>This paper presents the <strong>Green Cloud Abstraction Agent (GCAA)</strong> framework designed to correlate resource usage (e.g., CPU) and energy consumption in cloud infrastructures, supporting energy-efficiency strategies like workload consolidation. The GCAA implementation integrates power measurements gathered via <strong>Kwapi</strong> and <strong>IPMI</strong> into OpenStack Ceilometer to provide dynamic, precise power-to-usage curves. This capability is essential for orchestrators optimizing VM placement in both single and federated clouds.</p>

                    <p>This work outlines a framework for exploring the performance-energy consumption trade-off, vital for optimizing workload consolidation in distributed (fog/edge) cloud environments. The proposed <strong>Green Cloud Abstraction Agent (GCAA)</strong> architecture uses the <strong>Kwapi</strong> framework to integrate power measurements (via SNMP/IPMI) into OpenStack Ceilometer. This infrastructure provides the necessary energy abstraction for green orchestration, enabling algorithms to make efficient VM placement decisions.</p>
